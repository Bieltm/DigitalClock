# DigitalClock
This is my second practice in the second semester of my first year at computer engineer
In this practice, i complete my teachers code, so there are some classes which are made by him, and others made by me
The ones made by my teacher are: Step1 to Step7, ClockProgram, Padding, TimeTeller, Led, DecimalDigit and Clock
The rest of the classes are made by me, having to complete these classes with a code which could be compatible with the other classes.
The class ClockProgram is the one wich you can compile my code
